## Social Network API

## Description

Rook-Social-API is a simple social network API that utilizes multiple technologies that modern full-stack applications use today. Routing for our server is handled by Express.js, while the Mongoose ODM library models our MongoDB data. With this social network API, we add/edit/delete Users on our network, interact with other user thoughts with reactions, or even add and delete friends from our friend list.

## Acceptance Criteria
